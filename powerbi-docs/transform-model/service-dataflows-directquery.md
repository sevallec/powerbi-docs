# Use DirectQuery with dataflows in Power BI (preview)

You can use DirectQuery to connect directly to dataflows, and thereby connect directly to your dataflow without having to import its data. 

Using DirectQuery with dataflows enables the following enhancements to your Power BI and dataflows processes:

* **Avoid separate refresh schedules** - DirectQuery connects directly to a dataflow, removing the need to create an imported dataset. As such, using DirectQuery with your dataflows means you no longer need separate refresh schedules for the dataflow and the dataset to ensure your data is synchronized.

* **Filtering data** - DirectQuery is useful for working on a filtered view of data inside a dataflow. If you want to filter data, and thereby work with a smaller subset of the data in your dataflow, you can use DirectQuery (and the compute engine) to filter dataflow data and work with the filtered subset you need.


## Using DirectQuery for dataflows

Using DirectQuery with dataflows is a preview feature available beginning with the May 2020 version of Power BI Desktop. 

There are also prerequisites for using DirectQuery with dataflows:

* Your dataflow must reside within a Power BI Premium enabled workspace
* The **compute engine** must be turned on. For more information about the compute engine, see [the enhanced compute engine](service-dataflows-enhanced-compute-engine.md).

## To be able to create dataflows that can be use in direct query mode you need to follow this steps: 

	1. Create a Dataflow in power bi service
	
	https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/transform-model/service-dataflows-create-use

  2. To ensure your dataflow is available for DirectQuery access, the enhanced compute engine must be in its optimized state. To enable DirectQuery for dataflows, set the new    **Enhanced compute engine settings** option to **On**. The following image shows the setting properly selected.

  3. Once you've applied that setting, refresh the dataflow for the optimization to take effect. 
  
  4. Got to power bi desktop and sign in
  
	5. Go to Get Data and selected the "Power bi dataflows" connector
     You are going to get a view of all the workspaces that you have access to and when you expand them you will see your dataflows. Make sure you expand your workspace that          contains the dataflow that we just created and refreshed and then connect to the entities within this dataflow and click load or transform data 
     
  6.If you selected transform data, after your transformations when you click "Close and apply" you should get the below pop up. The same pop up you will get right after you click "Load"

## Considerations and limitations

There are a few known limitations with DirectQuery and dataflows, explained in the following list.

* During the preview period of this feature, some customers may experience timeouts or performance issues when using DirectQuery with dataflows. Such issues are being actively addressed during this preview period.

* Composite/mixed models which have import and DirectQuery data sources are currently not supported.

* Large dataflows may have trouble with timeout issues when viewing visualizations. This limitation is expected to be removed as part of this feature's general availability. Meanwhile, large dataflows that run into trouble with timeout issues should use Import mode.

* Under data source settings, the dataflow connector will show invalid credentials if you are using DirectQuery. This does not affect the behavior, and the dataset will work work properly. This issue will be removed as we approach general availability.
